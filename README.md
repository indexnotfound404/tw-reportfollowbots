# tw-reportfollowbots
There are accounts that only exist to inflate a Twitter user's apparent popularity. I call these "follow-bots." This script automatically identifies and reports follow-bots for a particular Twitter account.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3
- [Tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/)

## Getting started
You will need:
- A Twitter account
- Access to Twitter's API, via their [Developer program](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html)
- Developer access will give you the key things that you'll copy and paste into the code

## Author's notes
Twitter seems to want users like you to participate in their policing--that's why they have "Report" buttons--but it's not clear to me whether they want people reporting follow-bots. They appear to have some sort of rate limit on reporting--they'll stop your reports after you report some number of users--but it is not clear what that limit is. It might be 49 per day, or it might be 49 active cases. 

Use at your own risk; Twitter's governance structures are opaque and make no sense.
